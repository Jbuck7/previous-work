# Red Black Tree

This is my implementation of the red-black tree data structure. This project demonstrates my understanding of pointer mechanics, header files, unit test design, and memory management.

## Getting Started

To get started:

1. Run `make` to compile the code using the Makefile.
2. The Makefile will create executables named `rbt` and `speed`.
3. Execute `rbt` to run various tests ensuring the implementation's functionality. These tests are located in `RedBlackTreeTests.cpp`.
4. Execute `speed` to perform a speed test which creates a tree with 3.7 million nodes. The speed test implementation can be found in `SpeedTest.cpp`.
5. If you run either of these tests using a tool like Valgrind, you will see that there are no memory leaks to be found!
